# Introducing How Computers Work

### 1. How Computers Work: What Makes a Computer, a Computer? :

##### A computer is a machine composed of hardware and software components. A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions it is given and after it processes the data, it sends it back through an output device.

##### The input devices of a computer can depend on the type of computer we are dealing with but most typically we will find a mouse, keyboard, scanner or even applications (software) installed on the computer. Once the data has been received, the central processing unit (CPU) along with the help of other components, takes over and processes the information it was given. Once the data is ready, it will be sent back through an output device which can be a monitor, speaker, printer, ports, etc.

### 2. How Computers Work: Binary & Data :

##### All computer data is represented using binary, a number system that uses 0s and 1s. Binary digits can be grouped together into bytes. There are two popular methods for converting binary to denary.

##### Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data. A binary digit, or bit, is the smallest unit of data in computing. It is represented by a 0 or a 1. Binary numbers are made up of binary digits (bits).

##### Computer programs are sets of instructions. Each instruction is translated into machine code - simple binary codes that activate the CPU. Programmers write computer code and this is converted by a translator into binary instructions that the processor can execute.

##### All software, music, documents, and any other information that is processed by a computer, is also stored using binary.

### 3. How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic :

##### A logic gate might sound horribly complex, but it's simply an electric circuit with two inputs and an output. It receives two incoming electric currents, compares them, and sends on a new, outgoing electric current depending on what it finds. There are quite a few different types of logic gate, the most common of which are called AND, OR, NOT, XOR (Exclusive Or), NAND (NOT AND), and NOR (NOT OR).

### 4. How Computers Work: CPU, Memory, Input & Output :

##### Computers require input hardware, processing hardware and output hardware. The hardware that defines a computer is the CPU and memory. Without these a computer could not function.

##### The CPU and memory work together to run programs.
##### CPU - executes programs using the fetch-decode-execute cycle
##### Memory - stores program operations and data while a program is being executed. There are several types of memory, including: registers, cache, RAM and virtual memory.
##### Storage - stores programs and files long term, even when they are not in use. Devices such as hard drives, USB memory sticks or SD cards are used to store files such as photos, music and software applications long term.

### 5. How Computers Work: Hardware and Software :

##### Hardware refers to the physical elements of a computer. This is also sometime called the machinery or the equipment of the computer. Examples of hardware in a computer are the keyboard, the monitor, the mouse and the central processing unit. However, most of a computer's hardware cannot be seen; in other words, it is not an external element of the computer, but rather an internal one, surrounded by the computer's casing (tower). A computer's hardware is comprised of many different parts, but perhaps the most important of these is the motherboard. The motherboard is made up of even more parts that power and control the computer.

##### Software, commonly known as programs or apps, consists of all the instructions that tell the hardware how to perform a task. These instructions come from a software developer in the form that will be accepted by the platform (operating system + CPU) that they are based on. For example, a program that is designed for the Windows operating system will only work for that specific operating system. Compatibility of software will vary as the design of the software and the operating system differ.
