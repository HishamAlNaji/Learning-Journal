# HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR TEXT EDITOR :

##### if you want to write a good deal of codeyou need a good text editor that should help you do that.*often choosing a text editor ends up being a very personal choice*,you can search on Google for the “best” text editor for coding (and Google will definitely tell you). **I think the best text editor is truly the one that you enjoy using the most. That’s really the best one, isn’t it?**

## What is a text editor?

##### A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. **The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.**

## Text editors classification :

##### 1. a text editor that have these good features :
         1. code completion
         2. syntax highlighting
         3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
         4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. 

You might find some other
features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good
start.

##### 2. The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer:
          1. Text Edit on MacOS
          2. Notepad for Windows
          3. And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text editor already installed like Gedit.
          
##### *Honestly , They’re the barest bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.*


##### 3. Third-Party Text Editors options :
Each of these editors do have some if not all of the features that we talked about above, and most of these softwares are absolutely free! They are widely used in web development today.

           1. NotePad++ : NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only.
           2. TextWrangler/BB Edit : TextWrangler is for Mac computers only
           3. Visual Studio Code : Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft. ( it is my choice )
           4. Atom : Atom is a free text editor that’s available for download for all OSs By GitHub .
           5. Brackets : Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though more coding capabilities can be added through extensions. Being that Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this might be a great choice to start with. But still the choice is yours.
           
           
## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs :

##### An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
