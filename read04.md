# information you want to know about HTML and process design :

#### 1. Who is the Site For?
**Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.**

#### 2. You must know your targeted audience if they are indivisuals or companies .

#### 3. Why People should Visit YOUR Website ?
**Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.**

#### 4. What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve ?
**It is unlikely that you will be able to list everyreason why someone visits your site but youare looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.**

#### 5. What Information Your Visitors Need ?
**You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.**

#### 6. Site Maps : 
**Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.**

#### 7. WireFrames :
**A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.**

#### I think you should deliver your message across using design .

## lets talk a little about the HTML5 .

#### For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

#### HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

#### important tags for HTML5 :
      1. Headers & Footers
      2. Navigation
      3. Articles
      4. Aside
      5. Sections
      6. Heading Groups
      7. Figures
      8. Sectioning Elements
