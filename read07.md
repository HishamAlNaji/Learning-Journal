# General information :

## What is a script ? :

#### A script or scripting language is a computer language with a series of commands within a file that is capable of being executed without being compiled.The best example of a client side scripting language is JavaScript.

## Expressions and Operators :

### Operators :

#### JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

    1. Assignment operators
    2. Comparison operators
    3. Arithmetic operators
    4. Bitwise operators
    5. Logical operators
    6. String operators
    7. Conditional (ternary) operator
    8. Comma operator
    9. Unary operators
    10. Relational operators

#### JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator

### Expressions

#### An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

#### Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

## Defining functions
#### Function declarations , A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

    1. The name of the function.
    2. A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
    3. The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
