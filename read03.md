# Version Control Systems :

### definition :

##### Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

### classifications : 
   1. Local Version Control : A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
   2. Centralized Version Control : This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.
   3. Distributed Version Control : the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.
   


## NOW , Lets talk about a DVCS that named *git* :

### definition : 
##### Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
